# position example : quarterback = 'QB', runnerback = 'RB'

#weeklyPlayerStats('QB',2025,1) 

# 1. Who are the top 5 quarterbacks by passing yards? What’s their average completion percentage (cmp_pct)?
The top five is Justin Herbert his passing yards is 1,913 and his percentages is 67.5
Dak Prescott is passing yards is 1,881 and his percentage is 71.4
Matthew Stafford passing yards is 1,866 and his percentage is 66.1
Patrick Mahomes Not specified in top 5 for yards, but 66.1% completion rate.
# 2. What might a high cmp_pct tell you about a quarterback’s style of play?
A high completion percentage can indicate several aspects of a quarterback's style of play, but it doesn't tell the whole story. 
It typically suggests a player is accurate and makes sound decisions, but it can also be a byproduct of a conservative, short-passing system.
A more complete understanding requires analyzing completion percentage alongside other metrics like yards per attempt.
# 3. Which RB had the highest rushing yards that week? Who had the best yards per carry (rush_ypc)?
Joe Mixon of the Houston Texans had 159 rushing yards. 
J.K. Dobbins of the Los Angeles Chargers had the best yards per carry with 13.5. 

# 4. If a RB has high rush_yards but low rush_ypc, what could that mean?
A running back (RB) with high rushing yards but a low yards per carry (YPC) could have this performance due to a few large runs or because they have a high workload, which is often a sign of a team believing in them.
 They might also have a low YPC due to being on a bad offense or playing behind a poor offensive line.

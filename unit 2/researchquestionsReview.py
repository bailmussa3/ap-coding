2. Q: does defensive turnovers contribute to a team win percentage 
“Type: Relational. 
The question is clear and easy to measure.
I used data from Harvard Sports Analysis. 
Answer: Yes, more defensive turnovers help teams win.
+1 turnover is about 69.6% wins, +2 is 83.9%, +3 is 90.7%. 
This is right because the data shows it.
No change to the question.”





3. Q. who has the most passing yard of all time?
“Type: Descriptive.
The question is clear and simple. 
I used NFL record lists.
Answer: Tom Brady has the most passing yards with 89,214.
This is right because many sources say the same. 
No change to the question.”
